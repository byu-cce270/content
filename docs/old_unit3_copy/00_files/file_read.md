 - How to use the contents of a file.
 - How to write in a file.

## How to Add a File Into Your Colab Session
1. Open you colab notebook and click on the folder icon on the left side of your screen

2. This should open a menu for interacting with files in your session. Next click on the icon that looks like a paper with an arrow on it.

This is the upload icon and will open your files on your computer.

3. Navigate your files to find the file you want to add to your colab session. Click on that file so that its name appears in the box labeled file name and click open.

4. You should get a warning about making sure your file is saved elsewhere. This should already be done since you are using a file from your computer files so click OK.

Each time you open a colab notebook it starts a new session. This is why you must rerun your code blocks everytime. It will also require you to reupload your files everytime as well.

5. If everything was done correctly, you should see your file appear in that menu opened in step one.

Your file can now be referenced in your code blocks.
