<p><strong>Late Work Policy</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Late work will have a 10% penalty for each week it is late, up to 50% being taken off. This mean your assignment will be scored, then the penalty will be taken off.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Assignments are turn in by a sharable link to your excel file, colab notebook, or any other thing unless otherwise stated. Any assignment not turned in correctly or in the correct format, will receive a 0 until turned in correctly. There will still be a penalty for turning in the assignment incorrectly.</li>
	<li>All late work in each Unit&nbsp;is due at the end of that Unit&#39;s&nbsp;exam period. It will not be accepted after that day (unless you have lower than a 70% in the class). <strong>ONLY</strong> Homework and In Class Workbooks can be turned in late. Pre Class Quizzes can not be made up or redone.</li>
	<li>If an assignment is turned in late, it is your responsibility to reach out to the TA in charge of grading that assignment to have it be rescored. You can find out which TA is in charge grading which assignment through our class website.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Exams and Project Policies</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>There will be two midterm exams and a final exam. All exams will be conducted on Learning Suite and will have a time limit, based on the difficulty of the exam. There will be no make-up exams.</li>
	<li>Each exam has two parts. Once you open either part, you must finish it before the time limit.
	<ul>
		<li>Part 1 - Multiple Choice: This exam is closed book and just checking what you know, you will have 1 hour to complete this exam. For every 15 minutes you go over, you lose 10% off your exam&#39;s total score.</li>
		<li>Part 2 -&nbsp;Free Response:&nbsp;This exam is open book and you can use your homework and other assignments.&nbsp; You will have 3&nbsp;hour to complete this exam.&nbsp;For every hour&nbsp;you go over, you lose 10% off your exam&#39;s total score.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If you are unable to take an exam during the scheduled time because of a BYU sponsored event, or&nbsp;circumstances beyond your control, visit with the lead TAs or your professor <strong>BEFORE&nbsp;</strong>the exam&#39;s scheduled date and we will arrange something.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>There will also be three project for this class. One at the end of each unit. For each project, you will create&nbsp;a group with 2 other students (making a group of 3). This team will be your team for all projects.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>General Policies</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The best recipe for success in this class is to stay up to date on class attendance, homework, and projects.</li>
	<li>If you have&nbsp;foreseeable&nbsp;circumstances (approved school travel, surgery, major life events) that prevent you from completing the assignment on time, you must work out any agreements with the professor or TA&#39;s&nbsp;<strong>BEFORE</strong> the due date. In serious extenuating circumstances&nbsp;(injury, illness, bereavement, etc.) reach out as&nbsp;soon as possible. We&nbsp;will modify due dates or assignment expectations as appropriate.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Simply forgetting to upload your completed assignment is not an extreme circumstance, so please don&#39;t ask.</li>
	<li>If you have an academic accommodation please set up a meeting with your professor. We will develop a plan for you to be successful in the class.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Each of you should do your own work on the homework assignments. You may help one another and discuss alternate strategies for solving the assignments, but you must ultimately write your own spreadsheet formulas and python code. You may NOT work together with another student on a single spreadsheet or code and then later submit it individually. You also may NOT use or copy old homework provided by someone who has previously taken the class.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>If you have any questions about any grades received on assignments, please contact the TA that graded it. This information can be found on the TA page under the content tab.</li>
</ul>
