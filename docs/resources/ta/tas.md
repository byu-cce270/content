# Teaching Assistants (TAs)

We have a large team of TAs for this course who are here to support you. 10 TAs in total! They can help with course material, assignments, and any other class-related questions you may have. TAs are also responsible for grading your assignments.

If you’re stuck on something for more than 30 minutes, please reach out to a TA—that’s what we're here for! You can get help either in person during office hours or online via Teams.

Please make sure you're set up on the class Team, as TAs will occasionally share important updates and assignment hints there.

Most TAs are available to meet in the evenings. You can message them via Teams to schedule an appointment.

If you have a question about a grade, please contact the TA responsible for grading that assignment. You can find this information at the bottom of the page.

If you submit an assignment late, be sure to let the grading TA know so they’re aware they need to grade it.
