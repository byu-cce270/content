**Purpose:** This assignment will help you understand and become comfortable with using class resources. If you struggle to find any of the prompts, please ask a TA or a friend.

### Part 1 - Mounting your OneDrive
Mounting your OneDrive to your computer will allow you to store all of the assignments for the class in one place. You will need to download many files for this class, and having them organized in one place will make life much easier.

- Follow these instructions if you are a Mac User: [OneDrive for Mac](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sync-files-with-onedrive-on-macos-d11b9f29-00bb-4172-be39-997da46f913f){:target="_blank"}
- Follow these instructions if you are a Windows User: [OneDrive for Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sync-files-with-onedrive-in-windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49){:target="_blank"}

Once mounted, create a new folder for the class. Call it somthing like "CCE 270". You will store all of your Excel assignments in this folder for the class.

### Part 4: Turning in your Excel Workbook
For this class, **you will only turn in the links to your Excel files**. We will go over how to make any Excel sheet shareable so anyone can access it.

1. On the top right, click the share button --> share --> settings (little cog wheel next to the send arrow)
2. From here, we want your Excel sheet so that ANYONE with this link can edit. This will allow us to access the link you turn in. To do this, click "anyone" at the top, then underneath "More settings", change "can view" to "can edit". Then click apply. Your settings should look like this for EVERY Excel assignment that you turn in:
[INSERT PICTURE HERE]
3. Copy the link, then turn it into learning suite in the feedback box.


>**IMPORTANT** - Make sure that your Excel file is turned in properly. You WILL be docked points if not shared so anyone with a link can edit, OR if you turn in an Excel file instead of a link to the file.
