## Exercise 1 - Company Inventory

1. Navigate to the Company Inventory sheet.
2. Your boss has given you a list of customer orders. He wants you to sort through the customer data to show the top steel buyers, and then graph the ratio of material purchased. Here's how we can go about this:
3. Add filters to the table (Columns A:C)
4. Add a filter that only shows customers who ordered more than 15 tons of material.
5. Out of those customers, highlight all those who ordered steel. HINT: Use conditional formatting, and only highlight the cell.
6. At the bottom right of the table, sum the total quantity of material purchased (Cell C14). Note: Even though we have a filter, it will still sum the values of the WHOLE table (including those values not shown).

## Exercise 2 - Analyze Materials Purchased

1. Navigate to the Analyze Materials Purchased sheet.
2. Now that you have proven your boss your skills, he has given you a new task with more customer order information. Here are his instructions:
3. Format the table by adding borders, bolding the title, merging cells A1:E1, and adding colors to distinguish between the title, labels, and data. The goal with this is to clearly and neatly display the data in the table.
4. Add a color scale to the values in the table using conditional formatting (Cells B3:E26). Have the lower numbers be a lighter shade and the higher numbers be a darker shade.
5. Add filters in columns A through E in row 2
6. Create a filter that only includes the customers that ordered between 20 and 75 tons of material for Order #2 (column C)

## Exercise 3 - Temperature Conversions

1. Navigate to the Temperature Conversions sheet
2. Your boss loved your work so much that now you are the lead intern for the Google Spreadsheet division. He has now given you the task of analyzing the temperatures on one of his work sites to ensure building safety. Here are his instructions to you:
3. In cell C3 write in the equation that will convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius found in the "Conversion Equations" table. Convert the rest of the column to Celsius.
4. In cell D3 write in the equation that will convert from Celsius to Kelvin found in the "Conversion Equations" table. Convert the rest of the column to Kelvin.
5. In the "Statistical Data" table, find the average, max, min, standard deviation, and median from the values of Temp(F), Temp(C), and Temp(K) in the "Daily Temperature Data" table.
6. In the Daily Temperature Data table, highlight all temperature values at or below freezing in the Temp(F) column (as there are regulations against working in freezing temperatures). As a reference, freezing for Fahrenheit is 32 degrees.
7. Now, add filters to the Daily Temperature Data table. Only show dates that are before 9/22/2024.

## Turning in/Rubric

**_REMINDER_** - For this class, **you will only turn in the links to your Excel files**. You will get a 0 for this assignment if you turn in an Excel file or a link that is not shareable. 

1. On the top right, click the share button --> share --> settings
2. Click "anyone" at the top, then underneath "More settings", change "can view" to "can edit". Then click apply. 
3. Copy the link, then turn it into Learning Suite in the feedback box for that assignment.

**Rubric:**

|                      Item                      | Points Possible |
|:----------------------------------------------:|:---------------:|
|                                                |                 |
| <div style="text-align: right">**Total**</div> |       30        |

The following is not apart of the rubric, but specifies how you can lose points. For example: if you fail to share your link correctly.

|               **Reasons for Points Lost**                | **Amount** |  
|:--------------------------------------------------------:|:----------:|
|                 Link shared incorrectly                  |     3      |
|      Turned in late. 10% for every week it's late.       |            |
