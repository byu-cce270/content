#  In-Class Exercise: Analyzing & Managing Data

---

The following exercises are based on conditional formatting, graphing, basic equations, and filters. For this exercise, open the in-class workbook, make a copy, and follow the instructions.
You can find the in-class workbook here: [Analyzing & Managing Data - Starter Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o2_qgtB7Ggw3v8IjGLdc61Ld1jZy3snVAdMJGT7ZjuA/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}

## Exercise 1 - Company Inventory

1. Navigate to the Company Inventory sheet.
2. Your boss has given you a list of customer orders. He wants you to sort through the customer data to show the top steel buyers, and then graph the ratio of material purchased. Here's how we can go about this:
3. Add filters to the table (Columns A:C)
4. Add a filter that only shows customers who ordered more than 15 tons of material.
5. Out of those customers, highlight all those who ordered steel. HINT: Use conditional formatting, and only highlight the cell.
6. At the bottom right of the table, sum the total quantity of material purchased (Cell C14). Note: Even though we have a filter, it will still sum the values of the WHOLE table (including those values not shown).
7. Using the values in column B, create a pie chart to compare the total purchased amount of each material with these features:
      - A title
      - Each slice is labeled with the corresponding material
      - Display the total for each material on its corresponding slice.

When done, your graph should look somthing like this:

## Exercise 2 - Analyze Materials Purchased

1. Navigate to the Analyze Materials Purchased sheet.
2. Now that you have proven your boss your skills, he has given you a new task with more customer order information. Here are his instructions:
3. Format the table by adding borders, bolding the title, merging cells A1:E1, and adding colors to distinguish between the title, labels, and data. The goal with this is to clearly and neatly display the data in the table.
4. Add a color scale to the values in the table using conditional formatting (Cells B3:E26). Have the lower numbers be a lighter shade and the higher numbers be a darker shade.
5. Create a column chart using the information from the table with these features:
      - Customer ID is on the X-axis
      - Tons of Material per Order is on the Y-axis
      - A title
      - labels for the x and y axes
      - A legend labeling each order number

Your graph should look something like this when done:

6. Add filters in columns A through E in row 2
7. Create a filter that only includes the customers that ordered between 20 and 75 tons of material for Order #2 (column C)

## Exercise 3 - Temperature Conversions

1. Navigate to the Temperature Conversions sheet
2. Your boss loved your work so much that now you are the lead intern for the Google Spreadsheet division. He has now given you the task of analyzing the temperatures on one of his work sites to ensure building safety. Here are his instructions to you:
3. In cell C3 write in the equation that will convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius found in the "Conversion Equations" table. Convert the rest of the column to Celsius.
4. In cell D3 write in the equation that will convert from Celsius to Kelvin found in the "Conversion Equations" table. Convert the rest of the column to Kelvin.
5. In the "Statistical Data" table, find the average, max, min, standard deviation, and median from the values of Temp(F), Temp(C), and Temp(K) in the "Daily Temperature Data" table.
6. Create a line graph from the "Daily Temperature Data" chart to show the temperature on each day with these features:
      - Day is on the x-axis. Make sure that you check the box to treat labels as text or you will not be able to see all of the dates.
      - Temperature is on the y-axis
      - labels for the x and y axes
      - A title
      - A legend labeling each different temperature type
      - Give each data point on the Fahrenheit line a circle shape
      - Give each data point on the Celcius line a triangle shape
      - Give each data point on the Kelvin line a square shape

Your graph should look something like this when you're done:

7. In the Daily Temperature Data table, highlight all temperature values at or below freezing in the Temp(F) column (as there are regulations against working in freezing temperatures). As a reference, freezing for Fahrenheit is 32 degrees.
8. Now, add filters to the Daily Temperature Data table. Only show dates that are before 9/22/2024.
