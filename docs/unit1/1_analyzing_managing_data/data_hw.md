#  HW: Analyzing & Managing Data

**Purpose:** This assignment aims to test your ability to manage and format data. In this assignment, you will filter out certain types of data in different sheets. You will use the different ways of managing data that we went over in class: Conditional formatting, filters, graphing, and functions. The data we will be using is measurements taken from the Provo River. If you are interested in looking at more data from the Provo River you can access it at this link: 

[Provo River Data](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/10163000/#parameterCode=00065&period=P7D){:target="_blank"}
   
## Instructions
1. First make a copy of the starter sheet here:
   [HW Analyzing & Managing Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z9aHndUNtykZRRPncvE9h9ZbW7JfEta5npLSiirBanQ/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}
2. Rename it something like “[Your Name] HW Analyzing & Managing Data”

#### Part 1

1. Ok, so here's what's going on. Your boss from the in-class assignment, you know the one that promoted you... anyways. Well, you have impressed him so much that now he has invested in you to start your own company that monitors the local river for public safety. To start this new company, your old boss has given you projects. Here are his instructions to you:
2. Navigate to the sheet that says “Streamflow data Part 1”
3. Select the entire table and create a filter, the filter icon should be in each of the headers
4. Filter by Approved status so it only shows rows with an approved status "P"
5. Duplicate that sheet and rename it: “Part 1 Approved Status”
6. Go back to the sheet called "Streamflow data Part 1"
7. Reset the filter
8. Next filter the data by date. Only show rows of data that were taken before 6/21/21
9. Duplicate that sheet and rename it “Part 1 Date”
10. Go back to the sheet called "Streamflow data Part 1"
11. Reset the filter
12. Next filter the data by Flowrate (CFS). Only show the rows whose flow is between 45 - 50
13. Duplicate that sheet and rename it “Part 1 Flow Rate”

#### Part 2 

1. Navigate to the "Streamflow Data Part 1" sheet. Clear any existing filters (if any are still active).
2. Duplicate the sheet and name it "Part 2 Graphs"
3. Using the data from the table, create 2 different types of graphs. This could include a pie chart, bar graph, line, column, or whatever you choose. Whichever graph you do, make sure it includes the following:
      - Title (ALL Graph types)
      - Label X and Y axes (For line, bar, and column graph types)
      - legend (for line, bar, and column graph types)
      - Each slice is labeled and a count is displayed (ONLY for pie charts)
      - **NOTE:** Refer back to the reading and in-class activity for examples of the different types of graphs. The goal of this is to make sure your graph is clearly labeled and neat.

#### Part 3

1. Navigate to the sheet that says “Streamflow Data Part 2”
2. Format the table using colors, bold the headers, and make it easy to read.
3. Give the data in column B a scaled color scheme that will have the low numbers be green the high numbers be red and the middle numbers be yellow
4. Give the data in column C a color if it is greater than 180
5. Give the data in column D a color if it is equal to 230
6. Give the data in column E a scaled color where the lower numbers are the darker version of the color and the higher numbers are the lighter version of that color
7. Give the data in column F a color if the text does not contain a 5


#### Part 4

1. Navigate to the Summary Statistics sheet.
2. On this page, you will see spots to use formulas to summarize the data taken at different places on the river (or stations). Use the appropriate formula and data from your “Streamflow data Part 2” sheet to make those calculations in the top half of the table.
3. Most engineers when making calculations use Meters per Second. In the bottom half of the table, use the conversion factor in cell C20 to convert all the values in the top half of the table from cfs to cms. Hint: Don't forget to use absolute cell references!

## Turning in/Rubric
Turn sharing and editing on. Then turn in the link to Learning Suite in the feedback box

**Rubric:**
