  3. In Column B, Create a dropdown for the 4 types of materials found in Column E (Steel, Concrete, Lumber, Rebar)
  4. In column C, add data validation that ensures that the quantity does not exceed 25 tons (each customer is limited to <=25 tons)
  5. Fill out the rest of the table with dates, purchases, and quantities from the table found in E15-E18. Sum all values in cell C18						
  6. Freeze the dates and the headers of the table

  1. Navigate to the Temperature Conversions sheet
  2. Create your own functions in cells I13-I14 that converts numbers entered into cells H13-H14 to have a new value
  3. In Column B, create a list of valid dates. Use data validation to reject any value that is not a date
  4. In cell C2 create an equation that will convert from F to C
  5. In cell D2 create an equation that will convert to Kelvin
  6. Fill out the rest of the table with dates, Temp(C), and Temp(K)
  7. Using functions find the average, max, min, stdv, and median for the Temp(F), Temp(C), and Temp(K)
