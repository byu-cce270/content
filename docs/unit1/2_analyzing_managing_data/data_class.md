# In-Class Workbook

The following exercise is based on conditional formatting, data validation, and filters. For this exercise, open the in-class workbook, make a copy, and follow the instructions. 

You can find the in-class workbook here: [Analyzing/Managing Data, Conditional Formatting - Starter Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o2_qgtB7Ggw3v8IjGLdc61Ld1jZy3snVAdMJGT7ZjuA/edit?usp=sharing)

## Part 1 - Company Inventory

  1. Navigate to the Company Inventory sheet.
  2. Add data validation to only allow the user to input a valid date in column A below the header materials purchased						
  3. Create a dropdown for the types of material found in I3:L3 in column B below the Materials Purchased						
  4. Add data validation in column C that ensures that the quantity does not exceed 25 tons (each customer is limited to <=25 tons)						
  5. Fill out the rest of the table with dates, purchases, and quantities from the table found in E15-E18. Sum all values in cell C18						
  6. Freeze the dates and the headers of the table	
  7. Highlight the largest order using conditional formatting
				
## Part 2 - Analyze Materials Purchased

  1. Navigate to the Analyze Materials Purchased sheet.
  2. Format the Table to look nice (bold title, borders, etc.)
  3. Add a color scale to the values in the table using conditional formatting. Have the low numbers be a lighter shade and the higher numbers be a darker shade.				
  4. Add filters in columns A:E
  5. Create a filter that only includes the customers that ordered 50 tons or more of material for Order #2 (column C)

## Part 3 - Tempertaure Conversions

  1. Navigate to the Temperature Conversions sheet
  2. Create your own functions in cells I13-I14 that converts numbers entered into cells H13-H14 to have a new value
  3. In Column B, create a list of valid dates. Use data validation to reject any value that is not a date
  4. In cell C2 create an equation that will convert from F to C
  5. In cell D2 create an equation that will convert to Kelvin
  6. Fill out the rest of the table with dates, Temp(C), and Temp(K)
  7. Using functions find the average, max, min, stdv, and median for the Temp(F), Temp(C), and Temp(K)
