# Exercise 1 - Company Inventory

The following exercises are based on conditional formatting, data validation, and filters. For this exercise, open the in-class workbook, make a copy, and follow the instructions. 

You can find the in-class workbook here: [Analyzing/Managing Data, Conditional Formatting - Starter Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o2_qgtB7Ggw3v8IjGLdc61Ld1jZy3snVAdMJGT7ZjuA/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}

## Instructions

  1. Navigate to the Company Inventory sheet.
  2. In column A, add data validation to allow the user to input a valid date.
  3. In Column B, Create a dropdown for the 4 types of materials found in Column E (Steel, Concrete, Lumber, Rebar)
  4. In column C, add data validation that ensures that the quantity does not exceed 25 tons (each customer is limited to <=25 tons)
  5. Using the values in column B, create a pie chart to compare the total purchased amount of each material. Make sure it has a title, and that each material is clearly labeled on the graph. When done, your graph should look somthing like this:

# Exercise 2 - Analyze Materials Purchased

## Instructions

  1. Navigate to the Analyze Materials Purchased sheet.
  2. Format the table to look nice by adding borders, bolding the title, merging cells A1:E1, and adding colors to distinguish between the title, labels, and data. The goal with this is to clearly and neatly display the data in the table.
  3. Add a color scale to the values in the table using conditional formatting (Cells B3:E26). Have the lower numbers be a lighter shade and the higher numbers be a darker shade.
  4. Create a bar chart using the information from the table. Add a title, labels for the x and y axes, and a legend labeling each order number. Your graph should look somthing like this when done:

  6. Add filters in columns A through E in row 2
  7. Create a filter that only includes the customers that ordered 50 tons or more of material for Order #2 (column C)

# Exercise 3 - Temperature Conversions

## Instructions

  1. Navigate to the Temperature Conversions sheet
  2. In Column B, use data validation to reject any date after 9/29/2024
  3. In cell C2 create an equation that will convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Convert the rest of the column to Celsius.
  4. In cell D2 create an equation that will convert from Celsius to Kelvin. Convert the rest of the column to Kelvin.
  6. Using functions find the average, max, min, standard deviation, and median for Temp(F), Temp(C), and Temp(K)
