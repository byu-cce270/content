# Exercise 1 - Material Cost & Availability

The following exercise is based on the Lookups, Match, and Data Validation we have just covered. For this exercise, open the in-class workbook, make a copy, and follow the instructions. 

You can find the Material Cost & Availability starter sheet here: [Lookups, Match, and Data Validation Starter Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l0SP8OZHXpAFym_yioUuJcaL75-CNwOGcX5VW37_POA/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}

## Instructions

  1. Navigate to the Project Budget sheet.
  2. Apply dropdown (from a range) data validation to cells B2:B30 that references cells A4:A12 on the Materials sheet.
  3. Fix the error in the Project Budget Sheet that the data validation detected.
  4. Apply data validation to cells C2:C30 that ensures the material quantities are positive numbers.
  5. In column D, use the VLOOKUP and MATCH functions to find the correct unit cost for each row.
  6. In column E, multiply the material quantities and unit costs to get the total price for each row.
  7. In column F, use the VLOOKUP and MATCH functions to find the available quantities for each row.
  8. In column G, subtract columns F and C to find the remaining material quantities. Notice what this column lacks when compared to the table to the right.
