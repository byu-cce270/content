## Exercise 1 - Data Validation
1. Navigate to the "Data Validation" sheet.
2. Select a column from the table. Go to the data Tab in the ribbon above and click on Data Validation under the 
   Data Tools section.
3. In column 1, validate that the data entered into the cell is a number greater than 0.
4. In column 2, Create a dropdown list from the list of items in the range I25:I31 (You can either select the range 
   or type in each option separated by commas).
5. In column 3, validate that the data entered is a date in the past.
6. In column 4, validate that the number entered is a decimal number between 0 and 1.
7. Create a warning message for each column that will appear if the data entered does not meet the validation criteria. 
   The warning message should be descriptive and helpful, guiding the user to enter valid data.

## Exercise 3 - Employee Data

1. Navigate to the sheet titled "Pivot Table" and create a pivot table that includes the Job Title and Department 
   rows from the "Data" sheet.
2. Using the pivot table just created, provide a count of the number of people with each job title and calculate the average salary for each job title.
3. Play around with the pivot table to see how you can change the data displayed. For example, try adding the 
   Department as a column and see how that changes the data.
4. What does the data tell you about the distribution of job titles and salaries in the company? Are there any trends or 
   patterns that stand out?
