# Exercise - Employee Data

- employee data  [Pivot Tables/Query Starter Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19msUPf9DYVBAMNnoIhYO6RMpdSlKobbJM3Ul7W-qiCU/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.

The following exercise is based on the Solver Function we have just covered. For this exercise, open the in-class workbook, make a copy, and follow the instructions.

## Instructions
1. First, make a copy of the starter sheet here: {:target="_blank"}.
2. Rename it something like “[Your Name]-Class-Graphing and Numerical Solver”.

You need to create a topographic map of a hillside for a project. Your team has set up some GPS points with known 
horizontal distances from the base of the hill. Since the GPS device isn't accurate at giving elevations use the 
calculator below to find the correct elevations. Set up a goal seek on D18 dependent upon D19 changing to the values 
shown at the flag (you could also just type the value into the x input directly but practice using goal seek). To 
find the minimum and maximum elevations set up a solver for D18 dependent upon D19 that has the conditions $x>=1$ and 
$x<=1000$.
