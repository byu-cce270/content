# Exercise - Employee Data

We will practice graphing and using the Solver function in Excel. The data we will use is from a sample employee dataset. You can access the data here:

- employee data  [Pivot Tables/Query Starter Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19msUPf9DYVBAMNnoIhYO6RMpdSlKobbJM3Ul7W-qiCU/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.

Make sure to rename the starter sheet something like “[Your Name]-Class-Graphing-and-Solver”.
