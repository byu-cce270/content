# HW: Graphing and Numerical Solver
- pivot table link-   [Starter Sheet - HW Pivot Tables & Query](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1__eHBgjb9pZAlpfAtQ35LTMt8a-BroQ79vLmHEwzdzU/edit?gid=0#gid=0){:target="_blank"}

**Purpose:** Learn how to use Solver to solve complex equations and graph data.

## Instructions

A asteroid is headed for earth. You need to determine if the trajectory of a "asteroid-stopping" defense missile will clear the nearby buildings and destroy the asteroid before it impacts with earth.

An asteroid is on a collision course with earth, and you need to shoot a missile at it to obliterate it. 
Unfortunately a building is in the way, and you need to know if you can clear it with the current trajectory and 
land the remains in a safe zone. Use goal seek to determine the horizontal location of the missile when it reaches the height of the building. Copy and paste your answers into the appropriate cells. If you are right, something magical will happen!

1. First make a copy of the starter sheet here:
2. Rename it something like “[Your Name]-HW-Graphing and Numerical Solver”

### Turning in/Rubric

**_REMINDER_** - For this class, **you will only turn in the _links_ to your Excel files**. You will get a 0 for this assignment if you turn in an Excel file or a link that is not shareable. 

1. On the top right, click the share button --> share --> settings
2. Click "anyone" at the top, then underneath "More settings", change "can view" to "can edit". Then click apply. 
3. Copy the link, then turn it into Learning Suite in the feedback box for that assignment.

|                      Results are sorted by plant                       |        2        |
|         Query is created in cell A1 on days_lost_claims sheet          |        2        |
|       Query returns the 5 columns specified in the instructions        |        2        |
| All incidents where # of days lost > 0 and incident cost >0 were found |        2        |
|              Results are sorted in reverse order by cost               |        2        |
|             <div style="text-align: right">**Total**</div>             |       16        |

|                            Item (Pivot Tables)                            | Points Possible |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------:|
|                   Pivot table is created on a new sheet                   |        2        |
|               Table created using the data in the Data tab                |        2        |
|                   Table includes month and year columns                   |        2        |
|        Column created showing the count of the number of incidents        |        4        |
|            Column created showing the sum of the incident cost            |        4        |
|              <div style="text-align: right">**Total**</div>               |       14        |

The following is not a part of the rubric, but specifies how you can lose points. For example: if you fail to share your link correctly.

|                      **Reasons for Points Lost**                      | **Amount** |  
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------:|
|                        Link shared incorrectly                        |     3      |
|       Turned in late. 10% or 3 points for every week it's late.       |    3-15    |
