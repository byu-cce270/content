## Solver 
The Solver is a powerful tool in Excel that allows you to find an optimal value for a formula in one cell, subject to constraints on the values of other cells. It can be used for various purposes, such as optimization problems, resource allocation, and financial modeling.

The Solver can be used to find the maximum or minimum value of a formula by changing the values in the cells that are referenced by the formula. It can also be used to find a specific value for a formula by changing the values in the cells that are referenced by the formula.

The Solver is an add-in that is not enabled by default in Excel. To enable it, go to **File** > **Options** > **Add-ins** > **Excel Add-ins** > check the box next to **Solver Add-in** and click **OK**.

After you load the Solver Add-in, the **Solver** command is available in the **Analysis** group on the **Data** tab. These steps only need to be completed once.

After launching the Solver, the following window appears:

In general, the Solver is like Goal Seek in that it iteratively changes one (or more) input cell(s) until some condition is met. But in this case there are three possible conditions (max, min, value of) and a set of constraints can be defined. When we use the **Value Of** option, it is essentially the same as Goal Seek. Using the options shown above, we can solve for one of the roots of the parabola by clicking the **Solve** button. Doing so brings up the following message:

## Additional Readings

This is just a sample of the many things you can do with a solver. It is easy to use and can be extremely 
powerful and convenient. Here are some additional resources that you may find helpful:

Note that this is a slightly modified version the regional sales data set that we used in the pivot table example above. 

### Instructions

 ## Turning in/Rubric

**_REMINDER_** - For this class, **you will only turn in the links to your Excel files**. You will get a 0 for this assignment if you turn in an Excel file or a link that is not shareable. 

1. On the top right, click the share button --> share --> settings
2. Click "anyone" at the top, then underneath "More settings", change "can view" to "can edit". Then click apply. 
3. Copy the link, then turn it into Learning Suite in the feedback box for this assignment.

**Rubric:**

|                      Item                      | Points Possible |
|:----------------------------------------------:|:---------------:|
| <div style="text-align: right">**Total**</div> |        5        |

The following is not a part of the rubric, but specifies how you can lose points. For example: if you fail to share your link correctly.

|               **Reasons for Points Lost**                | **Amount** |  
|:--------------------------------------------------------:|:----------:|
|                 Link shared incorrectly                  |    0.5     |
