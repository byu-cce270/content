# Pivot Tables

**Pivot Tables** are used to summarize and analyze large sets of data in more meaningful ways. They can be used to narrow down data sets and see relationships between data points among other things. Pivot tables allow us to summarize multiple columns and rows of data at a time.

## Adding Pivot Tables
1. Select the cells in your Google sheet that contain the data you want to use. If you are using all of your data, you can click anywhere in the spreadsheet instead of selecting every cell.
2. In the menu, click Insert > Pivot table.

## Editing Pivot Tables
1. In the side panel, click Add, then choose a value.
2. In the side panel, next to 'Values', click Add, then choose the value that you want to see over your rows or columns.
  -Sheets often offers suggestions based on the information you choose. You can
   these instead of adding specific values.
4. It is possible to change how your data is listed, sorted, summarized, or filtered. Click the down arrow next to anything you want to change.

## Example Problem
Let's look at an example of a pivot table. Here is a data set showing the division, subdivision, product number, number of units, and price per unit.

By inserting a pivot table, we can create a table summarizing the data. One variation of this pivot table (shown below) indicates the sum of the number of units for the subdivisions in each division, as well as the average price per unit.
