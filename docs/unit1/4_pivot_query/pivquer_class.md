# Exercise 1 - Employee Data

The following exercise is based on the Pivot Table and Query Functions we have just covered. For this exercise, open the in-class workbook, make a copy, and follow the instructions.

You can find the Employee Data starter sheet here: [Pivot Tables/Query Starter Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19msUPf9DYVBAMNnoIhYO6RMpdSlKobbJM3Ul7W-qiCU/edit?usp=sharing).

## Instructions
1. Navigate to the high_salary sheet.
2. Create a query in cell A1 that references the employee data in the data sheet that returns the columns shown (Full Name, Job Title, Department, Business Unit, Gender, and Annual Salary).
3. Find all incidents involving employees earning over $150,000 per year.
4. Display the data in reverse order (high to low) in terms of salary.

5. Navigate to the senior_us_employees sheet.
6. Create a query in cell A1 that references the employee data in the data sheet that returns the columns shown (EEID, Full Name, Job Title, Hire Date, Age, and Yrs Since Hire).
7. Find all active employees* in the United States that have worked for the company for at least 20 years.
8. Sort the results by hire date.

9. HINT: An employee is active if the value in the Exit Date column is empty. Sometimes we can check for an empty value with (N = ") but in this case you have to use (N is null) because it is a date field.

10. Generate a pivot table that includes the Job Title and Department columns.
11. Provide a count of the number of people with each job title and calculate the average salary for each job title.
