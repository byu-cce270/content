# In-Class Exercise: Gantt Chart/Project Scheduling and Tracking

The following exercise will have you create a simple Gantt chart in Excel similar to the one featured in the video on the reading page and a few other features. 

We will use  seven main steps to create a Gantt chart in Excel.

1. Project Information, Phases, and Tasks 
2. Creating the Timeline 
3. Making the Timeline Dynamic
4. Add Gantt Bars using Conditional Formatting
5. AAdding Summary Progress Bars
6. Phase Summary Duration
7. Highlighting Weekends

For the in-class exercise, we will be creating a basic Gantt chart, later in the homework, you will be using a copy of this sheet to create a project management tool. 

To begin, open the in-class workbook and follow the instructions below. [(Starter-Workbook)-Class-Gantt-Chart.xlsx](%28Starter-Workbook%29-Class-Gantt-Chart.xlsx)

Be sure to rename the file to something like "(Your-Name)-Gantt-Chart-Class.xlsx" and save it in your OneDrive folder.

## Step 1 - Project Information, Phases, and Tasks

In this step, you will add the project title, company name, project manager's name, and project start date to the Gantt chart. We will also enter some phases and tasks for the project.

Note that some of the information has already been entered in the starter sheet for you. You should see the following:

![gantt_start.png](images/gantt_start.png)

### General Project Information
First, you will need to enter the following information:

1. Enter a name for your project in cell A1.
2. Enter your company name in cell A2.
3. Enter your name as the project manager in cell A3.
4. Enter a date in cell D3 for the project start date. This should be the next time you have class. Also name this 
   cell "project_start" (We will be using this name in formulas later).
* remember, cell or range names should not have spaces in them.

### Phases and Tasks
Now we need to enter some phases and tasks for the project. 

5. Enter "Phase 1" in cell A7.
6. Enter a series of tasks for Phase 1 starting in cells A8.

You can use "Phase 1, Task 1.1", "Phase 1, Task 1.2", etc. as the phase and task names. This is called the WBS or Work Breakdown Structure and is how tasks are referred to by project managers. In addition to the numbers, in practice, you would use wider column widths and enter more descriptive phase and task names in addition. 

Create at least 2 phases with 3-4 tasks each.

For this simple sheet, it is helpful if the Phases will be left justified and the tasks right justified. This isn't 
required for your homework, but it does help make the chart easier to read.

* **Note**: For  most projects the numbering for tasks is a sub-set of the phase number. For example, if Phase 1 has 3 
  tasks, they would be numbered 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3. So the tasks for Phase 2 would be numbered 2.1, 2.2, etc.  You will learn more about WBS structures and naming  in your 300 level CFM classes.


### Task Dates and Duration
Next, we will enter the start and end dates for each task. (We will not add start dates for the Phases).

7. Enter the start date for each task in column C next to each task. Typically, the start date for the first task is  the project 
   start date. For this project, the  start date for the first task should reference the project start date in 
   cell C3 using the cell/range name "project_start" we applied above.

* **Note** if the cell you enter the date into is is not formated as a date, a number will appear. Change the 
  formatting to a date format to see the date. The "Short Date" format is a good choice.


* **Note**: The instructions in the pre-class video say to add 1 to the end date of one task to get the start date  of the next task. This assumes that you cannot start the next task until the previous task is completed. This is not always the case. So just enter independent start dates for each task. The start dates should be ascending order - 
that is, the start date of task 2 should be on the same day or after the start date of task 1, etc. Most projects 
  have tasks that are done in parallel, so the start date of one task may be before the end date of another task.

 
Finish this step by adding your  your own start dates for all the tasks you entered.

8. Add a new column named "Work Days" in In F6, we used the title  "WORK DAYS" to indicate that the duration for 
   each task is in  work days (not calendar days).
9. Enter the duration in column F for each task in column C.
10. In D8, enter a formula to calculate the end date for each task based on the start date and duration. Use the WORKDAY() function to calculate the end date. The WORKDAY() function takes a start date and a number of work days and returns the end date. It ignores weekends when calculating how long it will take. 
11. Modify the formula in D8 to show nothing if the start date or duration is blank. Use the IF() function to check if either the start date or duration is blank. If either is blank, return nothing. Otherwise, return the end date using the WORKDAY() function. Then copy this formula to the rest of the tasks in column D. 

* **Note**: Use the IF() function combined with the ISBLANK with the WORKDAY function you used above. In English the 
  statement would be IF Cell C7 is blank, the this cell is blank, if not, execute the workday function. To make a cell 
  blank in Excel use "" with no space between the quotes. The format for the IF statement is IF(logical_test, 
  value_if_true, value_if_false).. The logical test would be ISBLANK(). The value if true would be "" and the value if false would be the WORKDAY function you used above.

### Formatting
12. Change the formatting of the chart to make it look more professional. You can fill the header row (row 6) with a 
    color, indent the task and phase names, and add some borders to the table. You can put boarders around  and 
    highlight the 
    project start date, work days, and start dates to help indicate that it is something to be filled in. You don't have to use the same colors as shown in our pictures.

At this point, your Gantt chart should look something like this:

![gantt_step1.png](images/gantt_step1.png)

---

## Step 2 - Creating the Timeline

In this step, you will create the timeline for the Gantt chart. You will use  a series of date functions including 
TODAY(), WEEKDAY(), LEFT(), and TEXT() to create the timeline. We will start the timeline in column H. You may want 
to review the video on the reading page to see an example of how this is done.

**Note** If you had more Phases or Tasks, you would need to adjust the range of cells used in the conditional formatting later..

In your Gantt chart, row 5 will be the dates for the timeline and row 6 will be the days of the week. 

1. In  cell H5 reference the project start date in cell D3. Use the name "project_start" you applied above.
2. In cell I5, enter a formula to reference the date in cell H5 plus 1 day. Then drag the formula to the right to 
   fill in the rest of row 5 for a week (7 days). Make the data go through column N.
3. Select the 7 dates, and use custom formatting to display only the day of the month. (You can quickly pull up the 
   custom formatting dialog by pressing Ctrl+1 on Windows or Command+1 on Mac). Select the "d" format to display 
   only the day of the month. _This may not be a choice, but pick one that starts with "d" and then modify it to 
   just be "d"._
4. Resize the columns to make the dates small boxes and center the dates.

### Days of the week
5. In cell H6, use the TEXT function to display the day of the week for the date in cell H5. (Hint: Use the "DDD" 
   format). Then, use the LEFT function to display only the first letter of the day of the week. So the formula in  H6 would be something like: ```left(text(H5,"DDD"),1)```. 
6. Drag the formula in cell H6 to fill in the rest of row 5 for the week.

### Week Header
Now we want to add a header for the week with the date of the first day of the week.

7. Merge the cells H4:N4 and use a formula in the merged cell to reference the date of the first day of the week in cell H5. 
8. Change the date formatting to display the full date in the merged cell.
9. Add a border around the week header and fill it with a color of your choice.

### Copying the Week
Next, we will copy our completed week to the next 3 weeks to the right to create a total of 4 weeks.

10. Select columns H:N and copy to the clipboard. Paste the columns to O:U. 
11. Modify O5 to reference the date in N5 plus 1 day. Now copy the columns O:U to the clipboard.
12. Paste the new columns to V:AB and AC:AI. At this point you will have 4 weeks of dates.

Now try double-clicking on the project start date to select a new date and watch the timeline update.

At this point, your Gantt chart should look something like this:

![gantt_step2.png](images/gantt_step2.png)


## Step 3 - Making the Timeline Dynamic

In this step, you will make the timeline dynamic so that it always starts on a Monday. This will ensure that the 
formatting of the Gantt chart is consistent. We will also highlight the current day on the timeline. We will use 
conditional formatting to highlight the current day on the timeline. 

Notice that the first week always starts on the project start date. But it would be more convenient if each of the weeks started on a Monday. We will add a formula to make this happen.
### Starting the Week on a Monday
1. In cell H5 (the first cell in the calendar row), enter the following formula and format the cell as a date. This 
   formula will calculate the date of the Monday of: the week that contains the project start date.
```
=project_start-WEEKDAY(project_start,3)
```

2. Experiment with the start date to verify that the formula is working correctly.

Next, we will add a new control that lets us display the week we want to see. This will allow us to scroll through the weeks of the project beyond the first 4 weeks. For example, given the phases and tasks it is possible that the entire project would take more than 4 weeks. By changing the display week, we can see that week on the left and the subsequent 3 weeks after that.

### Week Control of Timeline Display

3. In cell C4, enter "Display Week:".
4. In Cell D4, enter a number (1, 2, 3, etc.) to represent the week you want to display.
5. Change the formatting of cells C4 and D4 to make them match the formatting of the project start date (cells C3 and D3). Make sure D4 is formatted as a number and not a date. 
6. Name the cell D4 "display_week".
7. In cell H5, edit the formula you edited above to add "+(display_week-1)*7" to the end of the formula. This will  allow you to change the display week and see the subsequent weeks of the project. 
8. Try entering different numbers in cell D4 to see how the display week changes.

## Step 4 - Add Gantt Bars using Conditional Formatting

Next, we will use conditional formatting to add Gantt bars to the timeline.

1. Select cells H5:AI15 (if you have more or fewer tasks, adjust the range accordingly).
   * If you later add more tasks, you will need to adjust the range of cells used in the conditional formatting. If you use "insert row" to add more tasks, the conditional formatting will automatically adjust to include the new rows. If you add more tasks at the bottom of the list, you will need to manually adjust the range of cells used in the conditional formatting.
   
2. Click on Format|Conditional formatting and Select "New Rule"
3. In the Conditional format rules pane, select "Use a formula to determine which cell to format" from the dropdown.
4. We want the formatting rule to format the cell if the date at the top of the column is between the start and end dates for 
    the task in that row. We will need to use a logical AND function to check if the date is greater than or equal to the start date and less than or equal to the end date. The formula will be entered as if you were in the upper left cell of the range. Use absolute references for the row and relative references for the column.

    Enter the following formula:
```
=AND(H$5 >= $D7, H$5 <= $E7)
```
This rule looks at the date in row 5 of the current column (H\$5) and checks if it is greater than or equal to the start date in column D (\$D7) and less than or equal to the end date in column E (\$E7). The \$ before the row number makes the reference absolute, so it always refers to row 5. The \$ before the column letter makes the reference absolute, so it always refers to column D or E. The lack of \$ before the column letter in H\$5 makes the reference relative, so it changes as you move across the columns.

Make sure the cells in the Phase rows are blank. Highlight the Phase cells and hit delete if this row is getting highligted in the 
Gannt chart.

### Highlight the Current Day

Next, we will add conditional formatting to highlight the current day on the timeline.

5. Add another rule and have the formatting add side borders to the cells in the current day row. You should check 
    to see if the date in row 5 of the current column is equal to today's date. Use the TODAY() function to get today's date. The formula will be entered as if you were in the upper left cell of the range just like the rule we did for the Gantt bars. Use absolute references for the row and relative references for the column.

If you want, you can also change the fill color of the cell to make it stand out more or just highlight the date in the header rows.

If necessary, change the project start date so that the current day is highlighted on the timeline. That is "Today" 
is somewhere in the 4 weeks of the timeline.

At this point, your Gantt chart should look something like this if you added borders to the current day:

![gantt_step4.png](images/gantt_step4.png)

## Step 5 - Adding Summary Progress Bars

In this step, you will add progress bars to the Gantt chart to show the progress of each task. We be using a special conditional formating called "data bars" to show the progress of each task based on the percentage complete. We will also use conditional formatting to gray out part of the timeline based on the percent complete.

1. Select C7:C15 (The Progress column, adjust the range if required for more or fewer tasks), set the number format to "Percent". For testing purposes, enter some sample percentages for the progress of each Task in associated cells in the Progress column. Leave a few of them blank or 0 to indicate they have not started yet.
2. Reselect the cells in the Progress column (C7:C15) and add conditional formatting using "Data Bars". Choose a color, like gray for the data bar. You can choose a different color than gray if you like.
3. Make Column C wider so you can see the data bars better.
4. In the cells that have the Phase titles (cells C7 and C12 in the figures), use the average function to calculate the  average percent complete for each phase base on the tasks in that phase.

### More Formatting
4. Highlight each phase in the timeline and  bold the data in that row to make it stand out 
more.

Your chart should now look something like this:

![gantt_step5-1.png](images/gantt_step5-1.png)

## Step 6 - Phase Summary Duration 

In this step, you will add a summary duration for each phase of the project and you will group the tasks into phases so they can be hidden or expanded as needed.

First, we will add a summary progress bar for each phase.

1. In cell D7, use the Min() function to find the minimum start date for all tasks in phase 1.
2. In cell E7, use the Max() function to find the maximum end date for all tasks in phase 1.

Note that when you finish entering these two formulas, you will see an overall time range bar for phase 1. This is because the Min() and Max() functions are finding the earliest start date and the latest end date for all tasks in phase 1. However, our conditional formatting for the calendar is now showing the progress for the entire phase, not just the individual tasks. We will fix this in a moment.

3. Write the same average formulas used in Phase 1 to the Phase 2 row. 
4. Open the conditional formatting rules manager and edit the rule you created in Step 3 above. Change the formula 
   to the following:
```
=AND($F7<>"",H$5>=$D7,H$5<=$E7,$F7<>"")
```
This formula will now also look to see if a number has been entered in the "Work Days" column. If there is no number, then the conditional formatting will not be applied. This way, the summary bars will only show if there is a number in the "Work Days" column. This shouldn't ever happen if there is a start date and end date there should be workdays, but it is a good check to have.

Your chart should now look something like this:

![gantt_step6.png](images/gantt_step6.png)

Congratulations. You did it! There are many more features you could add to this Gantt chart, but this is a good start. See step 7 below for one more feature you can add. If you want, the  video in the pre-class and associated video's by the same author provide a lot more features you can add.

---

## Step 7 - Highlighting Weekends

1. Select H5:AI15.
2. Add a new conditional formatting rule using "Custom formula is" and enter the following formula
```
=NETWORKDAYS(H$5,H$5)=0
```
3. Set the formatting to a pattern color (not a fill pattern) to a light color of your choice. Also select a hatched 
   pattern to make it stand out more.

Your chart should now look something like this with the hatched pattern being on top of any previous formatting. If not, you can change the order of the conditional formatting rules in the manager or check your setting for your pattern color and fill color for your new rule.

## Turning in/Rubric

**_REMINDER_** - For this class, **you will only turn in the links to your Excel files**. You will get a 0 for this assignment if you turn in an Excel file or a link that is not shareable. 

1. On the top right, click the share button --> share --> settings
2. Click "anyone" at the top, then underneath "More settings", change "can view" to "can edit". Then click apply. 
3. Copy the link, then turn it into Learning Suite in the feedback box for that assignment.

**Rubric:**

|                      Item                      | Points Possible |
|:----------------------------------------------:|:---------------:|
| <div style="text-align: right">**Total**</div> |        5        |

---

The following is not a part of the rubric, but specifies how you can lose points. For example: if you fail to share your link correctly.

| **Reasons for Points Lost** |    **Amount**     |  
|:---------------------------:|:-----------------:|
|   Link shared incorrectly   |       -10%        |
|  Turned in late (per week)  | -10% (up to -50%) |
