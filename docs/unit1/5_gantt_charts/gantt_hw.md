#  Homework: Gantt Chart/Project Scheduling and Tracking

**Purpose:** This assignment aims to test your ability to create a gantt chart for a specific project. In this assignment, you will be given a specific project prompt and you will figure out how you and two other people will complete the project. You will then create a gantt chart that includes all the tasks and phases that you and your team will complete to finish the project.

## Getting Started
1. First make a copy of the starter sheet here:

2. Rename it something like ""

3. Remember to save it in your OneDrive folder that you created in the first assignment

## Gantt Chart Project Prompt

Create a professional spreadsheet that can be used to generate bills for landscaping clients. Your spreadsheet must include:

- At least three types of foliage, soil, and rocks, along with their cost per square foot

- A section where the client’s square footage purchase for each material is entered

- A way to calculate total costs based on quantity and unit prices

- An entry field for person-hours required to complete the landscaping

- Any other details needed for a clear and useful client invoice

## Gantt Chart Instructions and Requirements

Imagine that you are in a team of 3. You are making a gantt chart to help organize the creation of the "Landscape Invoice Tracker" based on the prompt above. The project manager is you. Your project start date is the next time you have class, and you have 2 weeks to complete the project.

Prepare a Gantt chart that includes the following:

- Break the project into 3 distinct phases (examples: Planning, Building the Spreadsheet, Final Review & Submission)

- Each phase should contain 3–4 specific tasks

- Assign tasks among the 3 team members

- Estimate start and end dates for each task

- Include dependencies when applicable (e.g., Task B can’t start until Task A is done)

## Turning in/Rubric

**_REMINDER_** - For this class, **you will only turn in the links to your Excel files**. You will get a 0 for this assignment if you turn in an Excel file or a link that is not shareable. 

1. On the top right, click the share button --> share --> settings
2. Click "anyone" at the top, then underneath "More settings", change "can view" to "can edit". Then click apply. 
3. Copy the link, then turn it into Learning Suite in the feedback box for that assignment.

**Rubric:**

|                                                 Item                                                    | Points Possible |

|                     Tasks and phases are included with each phase including 4 tasks                     |        4        |
|                        Start and end dates for each task are computed correctly                         |        4        |
|                            Phase start and end dates are computed correctly                             |        2        |
| Conditional formatting rule for task durations is input correctly and displays task durations correctly |        5        |
|                               Table is formatted with colors and headers                                |        2        |

The following is not a part of the rubric, but specifies how you can lose points. For example: if you fail to share 
your link correctly.

|                      **Reasons for Points Lost**                      | **Amount** |  
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------:|
|                        Link shared incorrectly                        |     3      |
|       Turned in late. 10% or 3 points for every week it's late.       |    3-15    |
