# Query Function
The **Query** function is a powerful function that is not available in Microsoft Excel, but is available in Google Sheets. In some ways, the query function is similar to applying a filter to a table containing a large set of data. Like the list option, it allows you to create a custom and often simplified view of the data in the table by apply one or more conditions and only display the rows in the table that match certain conditions. However, unlike a filter, the query function allows you to select and reorganize the columns that you want to view, including sorting the data by the values in one or more of the columns. Furthermore, with the query function you can create this summary of the table in an entirely different sheet.

The query function uses a query string that is based on SQL syntax. SQL stands for _Structured Query Language_. SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases. In the case of using the query function in Google Sheets, the data is stored in a table in Google Sheets and the query function is used to extract data from the table based on a set of conditions. Here is the general structure for the query function:

## Syntax

The syntax for the query function is as follows:

```=QUERY(data, query, [headers])```

The query function has three arguments:

- **data**: This is the range of cells that contains the data that you want to query. The data can be in the form of a range of cells, a named range, or a range of cells in another sheet. The data can be in the form of a range of cells, a named range, or a range of cells in another sheet.
- **query**: This is a text string in double quotes representing the query that you want to run on the data. The query is written in the form of a SQL query. The query can be a simple query that selects all the data in the table or a more complex query that selects only the data that meets certain conditions.
- **headers**: This is an optional argument that specifies whether the first row of the data contains headers. If the headers argument is set to TRUE, the first row of the data is treated as headers and is not included in the results of the query. If the headers argument is set to FALSE, the first row of the data is treated as data and is included in the results of the query. The default value for the headers argument is TRUE.

The way you formulate a query string is similar to how you would write a SQL query, but the syntax is slightly different. While SQL query strings can be fairly complex, for google sheets the syntax is simplified. The general structure of a query string is as follows:

```"SELECT _list of columns_ WHERE _conditional expression_ ORDER BY _column_"```

The **list of columns** is a comma separated list of the columns you want to include in the output. The **conditional expression** is a logical expression that filters the rows of the table. The **ORDER BY** clause is used to sort the output by a column.

The query string is case-insensitive, so you can write it in all caps or all lowercase, or any combination of the two.

Here is an example of a simple query that selects all the data in a table:

```=QUERY(A1:F5, "SELECT * WHERE C > 10")```

This query selects all of the rows in A1:F5 where the value in column C are greater than 10 and returns all of the columns. By contrast, this query:

```=QUERY(A1:F5, "SELECT A, B, D WHERE C > 10")```

returns only columns A, B, and D from the rows where the value in column C is greater than 10.

In some cases, you may want to apply multiple conditions to the data. You can do this by using the AND and OR operators in the query. For example, the following query selects all the data in the range A1:C5 where the value in column A is greater than 10 and the value in column B is less than 20:

```=QUERY(A1:C5, "SELECT * WHERE A > 10 AND B < 20")```

You can also use the OR operator to select data that meets one of two conditions. For example, the following query selects all the data in the range A1:C5 where the value in column A is greater than 10 or the value in column B is less than 20:

```=QUERY(A1:C5, "SELECT * WHERE A > 10 OR B < 20")```

In some cases, it is convenient to sort the data by the values in one of the columns. You can do this by using the ORDER BY clause in the query. For example, the following query selects the data in the range A1:C5 that meet the specified conditon and sorts the data by the values in column A:

```=QUERY(A1:C5, "SELECT * WHERE C > 10 ORDER BY A")```

You can also use the ORDER BY clause to sort the data in descending order. For example, the following query selects the data in the range A1:C5 that meet the specified condition and sorts the data by the values in column A in descending order:

```=QUERY(A1:C5, "SELECT * WHERE C > 10 ORDER BY A DESC")```

## Example Problem - Employee Database

To best illustrate how the query function works, let's consider the following example. The following worksheet contains a table of information about employees in a large multi-national corporation.

[Employee Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sUXazdoYdaaf5bpILrYyn8qKoJO5BTQ9aQ1Pdomc5J0/edit?usp=sharing)

Here is a screenshot of the data:

_(the data in this sheet came from this website: https://www.thespreadsheetguru.com/sample-data/)_

Now suppose we want to create a simplified summary of the data that only includes a subset of the columns and only the employees with a salary greater than $150,000. We can use the query function to do this. We also want to sort the results in order from high to low salary. We can apply this query a separate sheet. Here is the query that you would use:

```=QUERY(data!A1:P1001,"SELECT B,C,D,E,F,J WHERE J>150000 ORDER BY J DESC")```

Here is a screenshot of the results:

![employee_data_query.png](../4_pivot_query/query_images/query_high_salary.png)

Note that the range includes the headings and therefore the query results includes the headings also. You should 
also note that a query function is dynamic. If the data in the source table changes, the results of the query will automatically update to reflect the changes. This is a powerful feature of the query function.

Here is another query using the same data. In this case, we want to select only employees in the United States that 
are still active and have worked for the company at least 20 years. To determine if they are active, we will check 
to see if the exit date in column N is blank. We will also sort the results by the date that they employees were 
hired so that the longest servie employees are listed first. We will only include a few of the columns of interest 
in the result. As before, we will put the query in a separate sheet. Here is the query:

```=QUERY(data!A1:P1001,"SELECT A,B,C,I,H,P WHERE L='United States' AND P>=20 AND N is null ORDER BY I")```

Here is a screenshot of the results:

## Conclusion

This is just a sample of the many things you can do with the query function. It is easy to use and can be extremely 
powerful and convenient. Here are some additional resources that you may find helpful:
