## Instructions

1. In the first code block, write a print function that should return/print "Hello world".
    
    ```####             THE PRINT FUNCTION                 ####```

2. In the following code block, create 3 good variable names and 3 bad ones. Print out your working variables and then using comments, explain why your bad one's don't work.
    
    ```####              CREATING VARIABLES                 ####```

3. In the following code block, write 2 variables that show how variables are case sensitive and then print them out. (Hint: try using the variables "a" and "A") 
    
    ```####             VARIABLES ARE CASE SENSITIVE         ####```

4. In the following code block, write code to print out what type of variable y and z are.
    
    ```##STRINGS:```

5. In the following code block, write and print two or more boolean statements for Python to evaluate using the Python assignment or comparison operators on the W3schools website. [W3Schools Boolean Statements](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp){:target="_blank"}
    
    ```####                BOOLEAN VALUES                ####```   

6. In the following code block, write a comment next to the variables d, e, and f and categorize its type. Then write code to change the variable d into a string, e into a float, and f into an integer. Finally print your newly categorized variables. 
   
    ```####        SWITCHING HOW A VARIABLE IS CATEGORIZED          ####```   

7. In the following code block, write your own input statement and print out the response. 
    
    ```####              THE INPUT FUNCTION           ####```
