# In Class Exercise: Introduction to Python, Variables, and Lists

The following exercises will have you create a set of variables, formulas, and list in Python. For this exercise, open the in-class workbook, make a copy, and follow the instructions.

You can find the In Class Exercise here: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/byu-cce270/content/blob/main/docs/unit2/00_intro_python_variables_lists/(Starter_Workbook)_Class_Introduction_to_Python_Variables_Lists.ipynb" target="_blank"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

Be sure to rename the workbook something like "(Your_Name)_Class_Introduction_to_Python_Variables_Lists.ipynb".

## Instructions

After opening the workbook, follow the instructions in the workbook to complete the exercises. There are two parts to this exercise. Part 1 will go over the basics of Python and variables. Part 2 will give you practice with the basics of Lists in Python.

For Part 2, here is a list of common list methods. Here is a list of some the methods you will be using:

|  Method   | Description                                                      |
|:---------:|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| append()  | Adds an element to the end of the list.                          |
| extend()  | Adds all elements of a list to the end of the list.              |
| insert()  | Inserts an element at the specified position.                    |
| remove()  | Removes the first item with the specified value.                 |
|   pop()   | Removes the element at the specified position.                   |
|  clear()  | Removes all items from the list.                                 |
|  index()  | Returns the index of the first element with the specified value. |
|  count()  | Returns the number of elements with the specified value.         |
|  sort()   | Sorts the list.                                                  |
| reverse() | Reverses the order of the list.                                  |
|   len()   | Returns the length of items in a sequence or collection.         |

!!! Note 
    The len() method and count() method are both similar, but they are not the same. The len() method returns the number of items in a list, while the count() method returns the number of times a specific item appears in a list.

## Turning in/Rubric

**_REMINDER_** - For this class, **you will only turn in the links to your colab notebooks**. You will get a 0 for this assignment if you turn in a python file or a link that is not correct, wrong assignment, or does not give editor permission.

**Rubric:**

|                      Item                      | Points Possible |
|:----------------------------------------------:|:---------------:|
| <div style="text-align: right">**Total**</div> |        5        |

---

The following is not a part of the rubric, but specifies how you can lose points. For example: if you fail to share your link correctly.

| **Reasons for Points Lost** |    **Amount**     |  
|:---------------------------:|:-----------------:|
|   Link shared incorrectly   |       -10%        |
|  Turned in late (per week)  | -10% (up to -50%) |
