#  Reading: Introduction to Python, Variables, and input Statements

## Getting started with Python (Using Google Colab)

Google Colab is a cloud-based coding network that allows us to code using Python without downloading any software to our computers. On Google, search "colab" and that will take you to a blank Colab notebook. This is a tool like Google Sheets or Google Docs that can be found in your Google Drive.

# Pre Class Reading Assignment

On the O'Reilly's website read Chapter 2 in _Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition_  and Chapter 3.

## Things to Look Out For

- In Python, square brackets (**[]**) indicate a list, and individual elements in the list are separated by commas. 
- Python considers the first item in a list to be at position 0, not position 1. To access an element in a list, write the name of the list followed by the index of the item enclosed in square brackets.
- There are many ways to organize a list, you can use the sort method or the reverse method. 
- How do you add something to the end of the list and how do you add something to the middle of the list?
- What is the difference between deleting an item, popping or removing it?

# Pre-Class Quiz Challenge

Open a new colab notebook do the following:

1. Create 3 different types of variables:

>
   - String<br>
   - Integer<br>
   - Float


2. Use the **input()** function to prompt for the user's name. Then using **print()** function, print the name given.<br><br>

3. Create comments explaining what each of the 4-5 lines of code is. For example:

```python
#comment for variable 1
v1 =

#comment for variable 2
v1 =

#comment for variable 3
v1 =

#comment for input statement
i1 =

#comment for print
print()
```
