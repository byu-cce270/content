# HW: For Loops

---

**Purpose:** Learn how to use for loops to analyze lists. You will work with a list of beams and use for loops to 
calculate and print the deflection of the beams. Assume that the beams are cantilevered with a point load at some 
distance **a** from the fixed side on the left as shown in the following diagram.

The deflection at the end of the beam is given by the following equation:

>>$\delta_{max}=\dfrac{Pa^2}{6EI}\left(3l-a\right)$

where:

>>$\delta_{max}$ = the maximum deflection at the end of the beam<br>
$P$ = the point load [$mass$]<br>
$a$ = the distance from the fixed side to the point load $length$]<br>
$l$ = the length of the beam [$length$]<br>
$E$ = the modulus of elasticity  [$force/length^2$]<br>
$I$ = the moment of inertia [$length^4$]

The modulus of elasticity is a measure of the stiffness of the beam. The moment of inertia of a beam depends on its dimensions and cross-sectional properties. Here are some approximate moments of inertia for common beam I-beams:

| Beam Type | Moment of Inertia ($I$) |
|:---------:|:-----------------------:|
|   W6Ã—12   |       140 $cm^4$        |
|   W8x31   |      1,260 $cm^4$       |
|  W12x50   |      4,800 $cm^4$       |
|  W18x86   |      17,200 $cm^4$      |   
|  W24x162  |      66,000 $cm^4$      |


For multiple loads, the total deflection is the sum of the deflections due to each individual load. For this assignment, you will analyze a list of beams and calculate the deflection of each beam. For each beam, you will calculate the total deflection due to multiple loads using the equation above. We will assume that we have a steel beam with the following properties:

| Property |     Value     |
|:--------:|:-------------:|
|   $E$    | 20e6 $N/cm^2$ |
|   $I$    | 4,800 $cm^4$  |

## Getting Started

Create a copy of the starter sheet: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/byu-cce270/content/blob/main/docs/unit2/01_for_loops_into_functions/(Starter_Workbook)_HW_For_Loops.ipynb" target="_blank"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

Rename the notebook something like "(Your_Name)_HW_For_Loops.ipynb".

## Part 1 - Looping over beam lengths

1. Run Code Block 1 to create a list of beam lengths in meters.

2. In Code Block 2, append a value of 5.7 to the beam_lengths list.

3. Create a variable to store the value of the total length of all beams. Also create a for loop to calculate the total length of all the beams using the variable. After the loop finished, print the total length you find. This should be done in Code Block 3.

4. Calculate the average length of the beams and print the result. This should be done in Code Block 4.

5. Create a for loop to count the number of beams longer than 5 meters. Print the result. This should be done in Code Block 5.

## Part 2 - Calculating beam deflections

1. Run Code Block 6 to create the 'beam_lenghts' list.

2. In Code Block 7, delete the last length from the list and then display the contents of the list.

3. You will find in Code Block 8, are the given values for E, I, and the loads given that it's a steel beam. Run this cell to initialize the variables and the list

4. Finally, in Code Block 9, calculate the total deflection of the beam using the set of loads in the loads list for each beam length. To do this, you will need to loop over the beam lengths and then loop over the loads in a nested loop. Create a variable for the total deflection and set it to zero at the beginning of the outer loop, then add to this variable in the inner loop to add up the total deflection for that beam length. As you complete the outer loop for each beam length, print the beam length and the total deflection.

## Turning in/Rubric

**_REMINDER_** - For this class, **you will only turn in the links to your colab notebooks**. You will get a 0 for this assignment if you turn in a python file or a link that is not correct, wrong assignment, or does not give editor permission.
