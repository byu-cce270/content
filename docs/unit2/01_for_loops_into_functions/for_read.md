## Things to Look Out For

* The set of steps inside of your for loop is repeated once for each item in the list, no matter how many items are in the list.
* Make sure to indent the lines of code you want to be a part of the steps executed in the for loop.
* Any lines of code after the for loop that are NOT indented are only executed once without repetition.
* Make sure to include a colon at the end of the for loop statement or you will have a syntax error.

## Turning in/Rubric

**_REMINDER_** - For this class, **you will only turn in the links to your colab notebooks**. You will get a 0 for this assignment if you turn in a python file or a link that is not correct, wrong assignment, or does not give editor permission.

**Rubric:**

|                      Item                      | Points Possible |
|:----------------------------------------------:|:---------------:|
| <div style="text-align: right">**Total**</div> |        3        |

---

The following is not a part of the rubric, but specifies how you can lose points. For example: if you fail to share your link correctly.

| **Reasons for Points Lost** |    **Amount**     |  
|:---------------------------:|:-----------------:|
|   Link shared incorrectly   |       -10%        |
