# HW: Introducing Lists

---

**Purpose:** Learn how to create and manipulate lists to call certain information from them.

---

## Instructions

1.  Create a new Python notebook and rename it something like "[Your Name] HW 2.2 - Lists"
2. In the first code block, create four new lists with names: task_names, task_durations, material_names, and material_quantities.
3. In the task_names list, add at least 7 activities that would take place during the construction of building. (Ex. Foundation, Framing, Landscaping, etc.)
4. In the task_durations list, add the associated durations of each activity in days. 
5. In the material_names lists, add at least 4 materials you would need for the construction of this building.
6. In the material_quantities list, add the associated unit quantities you would need for each material to complete the construction of your building.
7. Print out each list with a description of what the list represents.
8. Using the project duration list, sum and print the total duration of the project.
9. Add a new task titled "Final Inspection" to the task_names list with an associated duration of 1 day in the task_durations list.
10. Remove a task from the task_names list with its associated duration in the task_durations list.
11. Print the new updated lists and new total duration of the project.
12. Update one of the quantities in the material_quantities list.
13. Add a new material like Drywall or Windows to the material_names list and add the associated quantity of that material needed in the material_quantities list.
14. Print the updated material_names and material_quantities list.
15. Write code to find and print the duration of the longest task, and the name of the task.
16. Write code to find and print the duration of the shortest task, and the name of the task.
17. Write code to find and print the average duration of the tasks.
18. Add comments to separate and explain each section of your code.

**Rubric:**

|                                               Lists                                                     | Points Possible |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------:|
|                         4 new lists are created and named correctly                                     |        4        |
|                          Required items are added to the 4 lists as instructed                          |        5        |
|                          Total project duration is summed and printed                                   |        2        |
|                    Lists are all printed with list descriptions included in comments                    |        3        |
|         New task titled "Final Inspection" with associated duration is added to correct lists           |        2        |
|       A task is removed from the task_names list and its duration is removed from the durations list    |        2        |
|                       New updated lists with total project duration are printed                         |        2        |
|                 A new material and new material quantity are added to the correct lists                 |        2        |
|                  Duration and name of the longest task are correctly found and printed                  |        2        |
|                 Duration and name of the shortest task are correctly found and printed                  |        2        |
|                        Average duration of tasks is found and printed correctly                         |        2        |
|                  Code is organized and comments are used to explain and separate code                   |        2        |
|                             <div style="text-align: right">**Total**</div>                              |       30        |

The following is not apart of the rubric, but specifies how you can lose points. For example: if you do not explain your code when using AI to help you create it or fail to share your link correctly.

|                      **Reasons for Points Lost**                      | **Amount** |  
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------:|
| No comments explaining why AI is used and what its provided code does |    2-3     |
|                        Link shared incorrectly                        |     3      |
|       Turned in late. 10% or 3 points for every week it's late.       |    3-15    |
