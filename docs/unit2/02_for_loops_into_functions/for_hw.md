# HW: For Loops

---

**Purpose:** Learn how to use for loops to analyze lists. You will work with a list of beams and use for loops to calculate and print the deflection of the beams. Assume that the beams are cantilevered with point loads at some distances a from the fixed side on the left as shown in the following diagram.

The maximum deflection at the end of the beam is given by the following equation:

$$\delta_{max}=\frac{Pa^2}{6EI}\left(3l-a\right)$$

For multiple loads, the total deflection is the sum of the deflections due to each individual load.
