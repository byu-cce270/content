# HW: For Loops

---

**Purpose:** Learn how to use for loops to analyze lists.

---

**Instructions**

1.  Create a copy of the starter sheet and rename it something like "[Your Name] HW 2.3 - For Loops"
<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/byu-cce270/content/blob/main/docs/unit2/02_for_loops_into_functions/for_loops_hw.ipynb" target="_blank"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
2. Under the given list of lengths, append the list to include a length of 5.7 at the end.
3. Create a variable that stores a value for the total length of all beams.
4. Create a for loop that will calculate the total length of all the beams. 
5. Calculate the average length of the beams.
6. Create a for loop that will count the number of long beams (all the beams longer than 5 mm).
7. Write print statements that will describe and print the values of your total length, average length, and number of long beams.
8. In the second code block, remove the last length from the given list.
9. Next, create a variable to store the value of the total deflection of the beam.
10. Create a for loop to calculate the total deflection of each individual beam using the given values for loads, distances, E, and I.
11. Lastly, create a print statement that specifies the total length of each beam and its deflection.
