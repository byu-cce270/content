# HW: For Loops

---

**Purpose:** Learn how to use for loops to analyze lists. You will work with a list of beams and use for loops to 
calculate and print the deflection of the beams. Assume that the beams are cantilevered with a point load at some 
distance **a** from the fixed side on the left as shown in the following diagram.

The deflection at the end of the beam is given by the following equation:

>>$\delta_{max}=\dfrac{Pa^2}{6EI}\left(3l-a\right)$

where:

>>$\delta_{max}$ = the maximum deflection at the end of the beam<br>
$P$ = the point load [$mass$]<br>
$a$ = the distance from the fixed side to the point load $length$]<br>
$l$ = the length of the beam [$length$]<br>
$E$ = the modulus of elasticity  [$force/length^2$]<br>
$I$ = the moment of inertia [$length^4$]

The modulus of elasticity is a measure of the stiffness of the beam. The moment of inertia of a beam depends on its dimensions and cross-sectional properties. Here are some approximate moments of inertia for common beam I-beams:

| Beam Type | Moment of Inertia ($I$) |
|:---------:|:-----------------------:|
|   W6Ã—12   |       140 $cm^4$        |
|   W8x31   |      1,260 $cm^4$       |
|  W12x50   |      4,800 $cm^4$       |
|  W18x86   |      17,200 $cm^4$      |   
|  W24x162  |      66,000 $cm^4$      |


For multiple loads, the total deflection is the sum of the deflections due to each individual load. For this assignment, you will analyze a list of beams and calculate the deflection of each beam. For each beam, you will calculate the total deflection due to multiple loads using the equation above. We will assume that we have a steel beam with the following properties:

| Property |     Value     |
|:--------:|:-------------:|
| $E$      | 20e6 $N/cm^2$ |
| $I$      | 4,800 $cm^4$  |

## Instructions

1.  Create a copy of the starter sheet and rename it something like "[Your Name] HW 2.3 - For Loops"
<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/byu-cce270/content/blob/main/docs/unit2/02_for_loops_into_functions/for_loops_hw.ipynb" target="_blank"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
2. Follow the instructions on the notebook.
3. When you are finished, turn sharing and editing on, and then turn in the link to your notebook to Learning Suite in 
   the feedback box.

The following is not apart of the rubric, but specifies how you can lose points. For example: if you do not explain your code when using AI to help you create it or fail to share your link correctly.
