## Things to Look Out For

* The set of steps inside of your for loop is repeated once for each item in the list, no matter how many items are in the list.
* Make sure to indent the lines of code you want to be a part of the steps executed in the for loop.
* Any lines of code after the for loop that are NOT indented are only executed once without repetition.
* Make sure to include a colon at the end of the for loop statement or you will have a syntax error.
