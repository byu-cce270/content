#  Reading: If Statements

---

## Pre Class Reading Assignment

On the O'Reilly's website read chapter 5 in _Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition_. 
</br>Here is a direct link to the readings: [PCC Chapter 5: if Statements](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-crash-course/9781098156664/c05.xhtml){:target="_blank"}.

Remember that you will have to sign in to you free account that you created earlier.

_Optional:_ In class we will be going over how to create different forms colab. [Introduction to forms and different inputs](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/google_colab/google_colab_adding_forms.htm){:target="_blank"}.

### Things to look out for
- The structure of an if statement, including the use of colons and indentation.
- How do you check if a value is or isn't in a list?
- Indentation of if and elif statements.
- What is a boolean expression?
- The difference between if, elif, and else statements.
- Can you use multiple elif statements in a single if statement?
- Note the different types of comparative operators such as >, <, and ==.

## Pre-Class Quiz Challenge

1. Create a new colab notebook.

2. Title the notebook "(Your_Name)_Pre_If_Statements.ipynb".

3. In the colab notebook, create a variable called 'exam_score' and set it equal to an integer between 0 and 100.

4. In a new code block, use an if statment to check that the user's grade is greater than or equal to 60. Print a message telling the user whether they pass or fail

5. In a new code block, use if, elif, and else statements to assign a letter grade based on the value of 'exam_score' using the following scale:

| **Letter Grade** | **Grade Scale** |  
|:----------------:|:---------------:|
|        A         |     90-100      | 
|        B         |      80-89      |
|        C         |      70-79      |
|        D         |      60-69      |
|        F         |    Below 60     |

6. Create a print statement that tells the user what their letter grade is. Great job!

## Turning in/Rubric

**_REMINDER_** - For this class, **you will only turn in the links to your colab notebooks**. You will get a 0 for this assignment if you turn in a python file or a link that is not correct, wrong assignment, or does not give editor permission.

**Rubric:**

|                      Item                      | Points Possible |
|:----------------------------------------------:|:---------------:|
| <div style="text-align: right">**Total**</div> |        5        |

---

The following is not a part of the rubric, but specifies how you can lose points. For example: if you fail to share your link correctly.

| **Reasons for Points Lost** |    **Amount**     |  
|:---------------------------:|:-----------------:|
|   Link shared incorrectly   |       -10%        |
