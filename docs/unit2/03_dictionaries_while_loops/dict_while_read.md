#  Reading: Dictionaries and While Loops

# Pre Class Reading Assignment

On the O'Reilly website read Chapter 6 in _Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition_ and Chapter 7, the section on "How the input() Function Works" and "Introducing while Loops." Don't bother with the other sections in Chapter 7.

Here is a direct link to the readings:</br>

## Things to Look Out For
- Dictionaries use braces {} as opposed to lists which use square brackets [].
- Keys and values are separated by colons, and key-value pairs are separated by commas.
- A dictionary's keys cannot be lists, but its values can be.
- What is the input statement used for? 
- How do you format a prompt question if it doesn't fit on its initial line?
- What is the difference between for loops and while loops?
- How would you code a stopping point if you wanted to stop the input program?
- While loops will only run while a condition is true, and will stop when the condition is false.

# Pre-Class Quiz Challenge
**Rivers with user input and while loops:**
Create a program that builds a dictionary of rivers and the countries they run through, using user input.

1. Create a new Colab notebook.
2. Title the notebook "(Your_Name)_Pre_Dict_While.ipynb".
3. Start with an empty dictionary called rivers. 
4. Use a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for:

  - The name of a river
  - The country it runs through
  - Store these as a key-value pair in the dictionary.

5. After each entry, ask the user if they want to add another river. Stop when they say **"no"**.
6. Use a while loop to go through the dictionary and print a sentence for each river, such as:
```python
The Nile runs through Egypt.
```
7. Use another while loop to print only the names of the rivers.
8. Use another while loop to print only the names of the countries.

## Turning in/Rubric

**_REMINDER_** - For this class, **you will only turn in the links to your colab notebooks**. You will get a 0 for this assignment if you turn in a python file or a link that is not correct, wrong assignment, or does not give editor permission.

**Rubric:**

|                      Item                      | Points Possible |
|:----------------------------------------------:|:---------------:|
| <div style="text-align: right">**Total**</div> |        3        |

---

The following is not a part of the rubric, but specifies how you can lose points. For example: if you fail to share your link correctly.

| **Reasons for Points Lost** |    **Amount**     |  
|:---------------------------:|:-----------------:|
|   Link shared incorrectly   |       -10%        |
