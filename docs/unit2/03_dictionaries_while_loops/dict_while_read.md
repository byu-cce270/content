# Pre Class Reading Assignment

On the O'Reilly's website read Chapter 6 in _Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition_  and Chapter 7, the section on "How 
the input() Function Works" and "Introducing while Loops." Don't bother with the other sections in Chapter 7.

## Things to Look Out For in Dictionaries
(either questions or bullet points)
- What type of Dictionaries use braces {} as opposed to lists which use square brackets []
- Keys and values are separated by colons, and key-value pairs are separated by commas
- A dictionary's keys cannot be lists, but its values can be


- What is the main difference in syntax between a list and a dictionary?
- How are keys and values separated in a dictionary?
- In a dictionary, what is the difference between a key and a value?

## Things to Look out For in Input/While Loops
- What is the input statement used for? 
- How do you format a prompt question if it doesn't fit on its initial line. 
- int?
- What is the difference between for loops and while loops?
- How would you code a stopping point if you wanted to stop the input program?

# Pre-Class Quiz Challenge
In a Colab notebook, complete this practice sheet. Submit a link to the completed problem in your Pre-Class Quiz.

**Rivers with user input and while loops:**
Create a program that builds a dictionary of rivers and the countries they run through, using user input.

1. Start with an empty dictionary called rivers.
2. Use a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for:

  - The name of a river
  - The country it runs through
  - Store these as a key-value pair in the dictionary.

3. After each entry, ask the user if they want to add another river. Stop when they say **"no"**.
4. Use a while loop to go through the dictionary and print a sentence for each river, such as:
```python
The Nile runs through Egypt.
```
5. Use another while loop to print only the names of the rivers.
6. Use another while loop to print only the names of the countries.
