# HW: IF Statements
---
**Purpose:** 
- Learn how to use IF, ELIF, and ELSE statements to analyze inputs and lists to determine a desired result.
- Practice using if statements with for loops and lists.

## Part 1
### Objective: Create a code that can, when given the correct inputs, solve the determinacy of any given truss. Determinacy is a Statics principle that helps us know whether or not we can solve the forces in a given system using statics equations.

Here is an example of a truss labeled with the joints, reaction forces, and members:

For this example, a student has given you a list of trusses he needs to solve for in his statics class. Because of your charitable heart, and your superb coding skills, you have agreed to help him.

### Steps
1. Open this Colab notebook and title it with your name: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/byu-cce270/content/blob/main/2_4_%5Byour_name%5D_IF_Statements_.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
2. Go to the "Part 1 - Truss Determinacy Solver" code block
3. Starting in line 2, create 3 different input statements to ask the user for the following:
  - The number of joints in the truss. (Must be an integer)
  - The number of members in the truss. (Must be be an integer)
  - The number of reaction forces acting on the truss. (Must be an integer)
4. Write IF, ELIF and ElSE statements on the next line under the "Write If statements here" line for the following scenerios
