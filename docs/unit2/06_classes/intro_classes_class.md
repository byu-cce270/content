## Turning in/Rubric

**_REMINDER_** - For this class, **you will only turn in the links to your colab notebooks**. You will get a 0 for this assignment if you turn in a python file or a link that is not correct, wrong assignment, or does not give editor permission.

**Rubric:**

|                      Item                      | Points Possible |
|:----------------------------------------------:|:---------------:|
| <div style="text-align: right">**Total**</div> |        5        |

---

The following is not a part of the rubric, but specifies how you can lose points. For example: if you fail to share your link correctly.

| **Reasons for Points Lost** |    **Amount**     |  
|:---------------------------:|:-----------------:|
|   Link shared incorrectly   |       -10%        |
|  Turned in late (per week)  | -10% (up to -50%) |
