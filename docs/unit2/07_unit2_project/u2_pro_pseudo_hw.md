# Homework: Unit 2 Project Proposal - Pseudocode

**Objective:** Practice planning a project using pseudocode.

In this homework assignment, you will practice writing pseudocode to plan out a project before you start coding. This will help you organize your thoughts and make the coding process easier. You will get back together with your group to plan and write out the pseudocode for your project. You can find the prompts and requirements here: [Unit 2 Project](https://byu-cce270.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unit2/06_unit2_project/u2_pro_prompt/){:target="_blank"}. You can also double-check who is in your group on that page.

## Instructions

1. Have one member of your group make a copy of this starter document: [(Starter-Doc)-HW-Project-2-Pseudocode.docx](%28Starter-Doc%29-HW-Project-2-Pseudocode.docx)
2. Rename it something like “(Your-Team-Name)-HW-Project-2-Pseudocode.docx”
3. Remember to have the team member who created the document, save it to their OneDrive folder that they created for Unit 1 and share it with the other team members.

## Part 1 - Choose a Prompt

1. Read through the three prompts listed on the [Unit 2 Project Prompt](https://byu-cce270.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unit2/06_unit2_project/u2_pro_prompt/#the-prompts){:target="_blank"} page.
2. Pick one of the three prompts that your group will complete for the Unit 2 Project. Under the "Project Prompt chosen" section of your document, write down which prompt you chose and explain it.

## Part 2 - Pseudocode

1. If you haven't already, read through the requirements listed on step 3 under the Instruction section for the [Unit 2 Project](https://byu-cce270.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unit2/06_unit2_project/u2_pro_prompt/#instructions){:target="_blank"} page.
2. As a group, discuss how you will go about the project and complete all the requirements. You don't need to worry about who will do what, you will figure that out later.  You may want to have someone take notes to help you write the pseudocode. 
3. Under the "How is your team going about it" section of your document, write out the pseudocode for your project. You can use the following as a guide for writing pseudocode:
     - Use plain English to describe what each part of your code will do.
     - Break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks or functions.
     - Use indentation to show the structure and hierarchy of your code.
     - Include comments to explain the purpose of each section or function.
     - Think about the flow of your program and how different parts will interact with each other.
4. You can also refer to the Pre Class Reading about pseudocode. [Pre Class Reading: Project 2 Pseudocode](https://builtin.com/data-science/pseudocode){:target="_blank"}

## Part 3 - Team Members and Contributions

1. Under the "Team Members Responsibilities" section of your document, you will find the following table:

| Team Member Name | Responsibilities |
|------------------|------------------|
|                  |                  |
|                  |                  |
|                  |                  |
|                  |                  |

2. Fill in the names of each team member and what they will be responsible for doing to complete the project. You can just put down each person's name once and then list all the things they will be responsible for in the "Responsibilities" column, or you can put their name down multiple times and list one responsibility for each row.

## Turning in/Rubric

**_REMINDER_** - For this class, **you will only turn in the links to your Word file**. You will get a 0 for this assignment if you turn in a Word file or a link that is not shareable. 

1. On the top right, click the share button --> share --> settings
2. Click "anyone" at the top, then underneath "More settings", change "can view" to "can edit". Then click apply. 
3. Copy the link, then turn it into Learning Suite in the feedback box for that assignment.

Only one team member needs to turn in the following in the feedback box on the assignment in Learning Suite:
   - A Word link with sharing turned on and editing on

**Rubric:**

|                         Item                         | Points Possible |
|:----------------------------------------------------:|:---------------:|
|           Chosen Project Prompt indicated            |        5        |
|    A plan is recorded and somewhat easy to follow    |        5        |
|              Functions are thought out               |       10        |
|          Variables are named and described           |        5        |
|  Roles are assigned and responsibilities indicated   |        5        |
|    <div style="text-align: right">**Total**</div>    |       30        |

---

The following is not a part of the rubric, but specifies how you can lose points. For example: if you fail to share your link correctly.

| **Reasons for Points Lost** |    **Amount**     |  
|:---------------------------:|:-----------------:|
|   Link shared incorrectly   |       -10%        |
|  Turned in late (per week)  | -10% (up to -50%) |
