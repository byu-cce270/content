# In Class Exercise: Introducing Lists

The following exercises will have you create a formulas and input statements in python. For this exercise, open the in-class workbook, make a copy, and follow the instructions.

You can find the In Class Exercise here: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/byu-cce270/content/blob/main/docs/unit2/0_intro_python_variables/%5BStarter_Sheet%5D_In_Class_Introduction_to_Python%2C_Variables%2C_and_input_Statements.ipynb" target="_blank"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

## Instructions

1. In the first code block, write a print function that should return/print "Hello world".
    ```python
    ####             THE PRINT FUNCTION                 ####
    ```

2. In the following code block, create 3 good variable names and 3 bad ones. Print out your working variables and then using comments, explain why your bad one's don't work.
    ```python
    ####              CREATING VARIABLES                 ####
    ```

3. In the following code block, write 2 variables that show how variables are case sensitive and then print them out. (Hint: try using the variables "a" and "A") 
    ```python
    ####             VARIABLES ARE CASE SENSITIVE         ####
    ```
   
4. In the following code block, write code to print out what type of variable y and z are.
    ```python
    ##STRINGS:
    ```
   
5. In the following code block, write and print two or more boolean statements for Python to evaluate using the Python assignment or comparison operators on the W3schools website. [W3Schools Boolean Statements](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp){:target="_blank"}
    ```python
    ####                BOOLEAN VALUES                ####
    ```   

6. In the following code block, write a comment next to the variables d, e, and f and categorize its type. Then write code to change the variable d into a string, e into a float, and f into an integer. Finally print your newly categorized variables. 
    ```python
    ####        SWITCHING HOW A VARIABLE IS CATEGORIZED          ####
    ```   

7. In the following code block, write your own input statement and print our the response. 
    ```python
    ####              THE INPUT FUNCTION           ####
    ```
