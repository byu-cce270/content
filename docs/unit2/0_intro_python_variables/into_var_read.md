#  Reading: Introduction to Python, Variables, and input Statements

## Getting started with Python (Using Google Colab)

Google Colab is a cloud-based coding network that allows us to code using Python without downloading any software to our computers. 

On Google search "colab" and that will take you to a blank Colab notebook. This is another tool like Google Sheets and Google Docs that can be found in your Google Drive.

# Pre Class Reading Assignment

On the O'Reilly's website read chapter 2 in _Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition_  and chapter 7, the section on "How the input() Function Works". 
</br>Here is a direct link to the readings: [PCC Chapter 2: Variables and Simple Data Types](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-crash-course/9781098156664/c02.xhtml){:target="_blank"} and [PCC Chapter 7: How the input() Fucntion Works](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-crash-course/9781098156664/c07.xhtml#h1-502703c07-0001){:target="_blank"}.

## Things to Look Out For

# Pre-Class Quiz Challenge

Open a new colab notebook do the following:

1. Create 3 different types of variables
   1. String
   2. Integer
   3. Float

2. Use the input() function to prompt for the user's name. Then using print() function, print the name given.

3. Create comments explaining what each of the 4-5 lines of code is. For example:

```python
#comment for variable 1
v1 =

#comment for variable 2
v1 =

#comment for variable 3
v1 =

#comment for input statement
i1 =

#comment for print
print()
```
