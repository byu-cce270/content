# **HW: Lists**

---

**Purpose:** Learn how to create and manipulate lists to call certain information from them.

---

**Instructions**

1.  Create a new Python notebook and rename it something like "[Your Name] HW 2.2 - Lists"
2. In the first code block, create four new lists with names: task_names, task_durations, material_names, and material_quanities.
3. In the task_names list, add at least 7 activities that would take place during the construction of building. (Ex. Foundation, Framing, Landscaping, etc.)
4. In the task_durations list, add the associated durations of each activity in days. 
5. In the material_names lists, add at least 4 materials you would need for the construction of this building.
6. In the material_quantities list, add the associated unit quanitites you would need of each material to complete construction of your building.
7. Print out each list with a description of what the list represents.
8. Using the project duration list, sum and print the total duration of the project.
9. Add a new task titled "Final Inspection" to the task_names list with an associated duration of 1 day in the task_durations list.
10. Remove a task from the task_names list with its associated duration in the task_durations list.
11. Print the new updated lists and new total duration of the project.
12. Update one of the quantities in the material_quantities list.
13. Add a new material like Drywall or Windows to the material_names list and add the associated quantity of that material needed in the material_quanitites list.
14. Print the updated material_names and material_quanitities list.
15. Write code to find and print the duration of the longest task, and the name of the task.
16. Write code to find and print the duration of the shortest task, and the name of the task.
17. Write code to find and print the average duration of the tasks.
18. Turn on sharing and editing for your code and submit the link to Learning Suite in the feedback box.
