#  HW: Reading and Writing Files

**Purpose:** In this assignment you are given a csv file for the Provo River Flow Summary Statistics. You will download the file and create a DataFrame out of the data provided and manipulate your DataFrame. 
You can find where to access this data [here](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=10163000)

## Instructions

1. First, make a copy of the starter sheet here: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/byu-cce270/content/blob/main/docs/unit3/03_pandas_part1/hw_startersheet_pandas_part1.ipynb" target="_blank"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
2. Rename it something like "[Your Name] 3_4_Pandas-Part1_HW"

You will be using the following data set:
[ProvoRiverData](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17669682/ProvoRiverData.csv)

---

### Creating and Formatting the DataFrame

1. Upload the Provo River Data csv file to your python notebook.
2. Write appropriate import statements to read the file into a pandas dataframe.
3. In the second code block display the table that pandas made.
4. In the third code block write code that will display a table like this:
   
![df_python](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6726e28-0559-4b73-8d13-6883bf984877)

5. In the fourth code block find the shape of the initial data frame (how many columns and rows there are).
6. In the fifth code blcok display a asumary of the Date/Time column. It should look something like this:
   
![python_df](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b494e31f-8f49-4a10-8fbf-c6ea8bafe1cc)

7. In the sixth code block display the last 8 rows of the table.
8. In the seventh code blcok create a table that only shows flowrate over 100.
9. In the eighth code blcok create a table that only shows Approved Status 'P'.
10. Turn sharing, editing on. Then turn in your link to Learning Suite.
