# Turning In/Rubric

Turn on sharing and editing. Turn in the link to the Learning Suite feedback box. ONLY turn in the workbook. **You don't need to turn in the file you created.

|        First code block has import statements and uploads file correctly        |     5      |
|        Second code block displays the table that pandas made        |     3     |
|            Third code block displays flow rate data summary            |     2      |
|  Fourth code block finds the shape of the table  |     2      |
|  Fifth code block displays a summary of the Date/Time column  |     2     |

The following is not apart of the rubric, but specifies how you can lose points. For example: if you do not explain your code when using AI to help you create it or fail to share your link correctly.

|                      **Reasons for Points Lost**                      | **Amount** |  
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------:|
| No comments explaining why AI is used and what its provided code does |    2-3     |
|                        Link shared incorrectly                        |     3      |
|       Turned in late. 10% or 3 points for every week it's late.       |    3-15    |
