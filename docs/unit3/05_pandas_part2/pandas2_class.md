After opening the notebook, drag and drop the files into the file explorer on the left side of the notebook. It may be closed, but you can open it by clicking on the folder icon on the left side of the screen, to open the file explorer in Colab. 

This spreadsheet contains data on accidents from 2020 to 2022. You will be using this data to complete the exercises in the notebook. The spreadsheet contains columns for the date, Injury Location, Gender, Age Group, Incident Type, Days Lost, Plant, Report Type, Shift, Department, and IIncident cost. 

We will be using the panda's groupby function to summary and analyze these data. 

In addition to the accident data, we will be working with datetime data to both manually create datetime data and to create additional columns to help summary data.
