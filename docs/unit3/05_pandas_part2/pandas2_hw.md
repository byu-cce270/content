#  HW: Manipulating and Grouping Pandas DataFrames

**Purpose:** In this assignment you are given an Excel file for different excavation and grading equipment. You will upload the provided file to your Colab notebook and practice merging, grouping, and manipulating the data in Python. 

## Instructions

1. First, make a copy of the starter sheet here: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/byu-cce270/content/blob/main/docs/unit3/04_pandas_part2/HW_Pandas_Part_2.ipynb#scrollTo=0Z04HkIOYDLu" target="_blank"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
2. Rename it something like "[Your Name] 3_5_Pandas-Part2_HW"

# Turning In/Rubric

Turn on sharing and editing. Turn in the link to the Learning Suite feedback box. ONLY turn in the workbook. **You don't need to turn in the file you created. 
**

|                      **Item**                       | **Amount** |
|:---------------------------------------------------:|:----------:|
|        Correct import statements used and file uploaded correctly        |     5      |
|        Tabs in the Excel file are loaded in separate data frames        |     3     |
|            Correct column names created with duplicates removed            |     3      |
|                Equipment age calculated correctly  |     3     |
|    Equipment and Productivity dataframes are merged into a new dataframe correctly  |     2     |
|  Correct columns with correct calculations are added to the merged dataframe  |     8      |
|              .groupby() is used to filter correctly  |     3      |
|   Bar graph displays correctly with titles, labels, and colors |     3      |
|   <div style="text-align: right">**Total**</div>    |   **30**   |

The following is not apart of the rubric, but specifies how you can lose points. For example: if you do not explain your code when using AI to help you create it or fail to share your link correctly.

|                      **Reasons for Points Lost**                      | **Amount** |  
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------:|
| No comments explaining why AI is used and what its provided code does |    2-3     |
|                        Link shared incorrectly                        |     3      |
|       Turned in late. 10% or 3 points for every week it's late.       |    3-15    |
