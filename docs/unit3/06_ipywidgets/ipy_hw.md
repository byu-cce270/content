# Homework: ipywidgets

**Objective:** Learn how to use ipywidgets to create interactive widgets in Google Colab.

Here is the documentation for ipywidgets for your convenience: [ipywidgets Documentation](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20List.html)

In this homework assignment, you will practice using random numbers, making GUI’s and being creative. 

## Instructions

1. First make a copy of the starter sheet here:  Starter Sheet HW 3.4 - Random Numbers.ipynb 
2. Rename it something like “[your name]_Homework-ipywidgets.ipynb” 
3. Chose two of the following prompts:
      - Rock paper scissors
      - Number Guessing game
      - Password generator
4. Add the following elements to each prompt (include which ones you choose in your code and when you submit it):
      - Add markdown/HTML with the instructions. 
      - Add three GUIs for user interaction 
      - Show the results in an HTML GUI
5. Turn sharing, editing on. Then turn in the link to learning suite in the feedback box

### Ideas for GUIs

1. Rock Paper Scissors
    - Add three buttons for the user choices.  When the player chooses one button (the rock, paper, or scissors button), the computer will randomly choose one of the three options.
2. Number Guessing Game
    - Add a text box for the user to input their guess.  When the user clicks the submit button, the computer will randomly choose a number between 1 and 100.  The user will be told if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
3. Password Generator
    - Add a GUI with an appropriate combination of integer sliders checkboxes and/or drop down lists to allow the user to specify the number or characters, uppercase letters, symbols, and numbers to be included.  Add a button to generate the password using the requirements specified.  Add an HTML widget to show the resulting password.
