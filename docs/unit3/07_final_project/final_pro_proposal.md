#  Final Project Proposal

**Purpose:** The purpose of this assignment is to give you and your group a chance to plan and split up the different parts of the project. 

You and the rest of your team previously formed will work together will come up with a project idea that will showcase what you have learned in this class. You can find your team here:

## Instructions

1. Together as a team, read through the project requirements and decide on a project idea that will meet all of the requirements. You can find the project requirements here: [Final Project](https://byu-cce270.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unit3/07_final_project/final_pro_prompt/){:target="_blank"}.

2. As your group discusses how you will go about the project, take notes. It would even helpful to write some pseudocode to help plan out the specifics of how the code is layed out.   

3. After your group has a general plan, discuss how to divide up the roles and to later indicate it on the project proposal. 

4. Once you have decided on a project idea and how the roles will be divide up, you will need to create a project proposal. The project proposal will help you figure out how to work together as a team and meet all the requirements. Including who will do what, how long each step will take, what resources you will need, and what order things need to be done in.

5. The project proposal will need to include  a Gantt Chart made using google sheets. Your Gantt Chart should include:
      - The project name 
      - The names of the team members
      - The start and end dates of the project
      - The tasks that need to be completed
      - The person responsible for each task
      - The resources needed for each task
      - The order in which the tasks need to be completed
      - The time each task will take
      - The milestones that need to be met 
      - The project completion date
      - Either on the Gantt Chart in in paragraphs by the chart, explain each task including how they relate to each other.
   
    A milestone is the thing that gets completed on each task - a marker of how well you are doing. 
    For a helpful guide on how to create/make a Gantt Chart, you can review when we did Gantt Charts during the spreadsheet unit. [Gantt Chart Reading](https://byu-cce270.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unit1/5_gantt_charts/gantt_read/){:target="_blank"}

The following is not a part of the rubric, but specifies how you can lose points. For example: if you do not explain your code when using AI to help you create it or fail to share your link correctly.
